## Game Customization
This game was built using Kaboom.js and lives here: https://replit.com/@loretod/One-Button-Zen

It was developed for the One Button Game Jam hosted on itch.io to support players who use single switches for play.

Users are encouraged to fork the game from replit and change the game parameter variables to meet the needs of the player.
